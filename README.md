<b>Blackpink website ASG1</b><br>
The overview of my project is to create a website for blackpink(a kpop group) so that the fans can know more about them and show their support. My website is showing about their information, their music , as well as their events and contact information.<br>

<b>Design Process</b><br>
At first I chose my band, then I started to think of what should i add in my website. I went to research about them. I made the decision to give more infomation about their music than their mechandise. 
Afterwards, i started to design my wireframe so i can have a rough idea of how my website would look like as well as how many pages I am going to do.<br>
Below is my wireframe link:<br>
