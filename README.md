<b>Blackpink website ASG1</b><br>
The overview of my project is to create a website for blackpink(a kpop group) so that the fans can know more about them and show their support. My website is showing about their information, their music , as well as their events and contact information.<br>

<b>Design Process</b><br>
At first I chose my band, then I started to think of what should i add in my website. I went to research about them. I made the decision to give more infomation about their music than their mechandise. 
Afterwards, i started to design my wireframe so i can have a rough idea of how my website would look like as well as how many pages I am going to do.<br>
Below is my wireframe link:<br>

Afterwards I began starting to code my layout on website and used css style and java script to complete my whole 12 pages.<br>
<br>
<b>Existing Features</b><br>
I have the about page where user just need to click on any image then it will go to the details page, there are also buttons to move from one page to another.<br>
